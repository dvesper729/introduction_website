		<h1>About Me</h1>
	<div class="main">

		<p>	I was born and raised in Carmel, Indiana, and currently live in Bloomington, Indiana as a student at Indiana University Bloomington. As an undergraduate, I have studied East Asian Languages and Cultures, focusing on Japan and Japanese language. I have completed coursework focusing on the theoretical framework of cultural studies, as well as studies in various cultural forms of contemporary and past Japan. I have also studied Media with a concentration in Film, Television, and Digital Production. Through this program, I have achieved competency in various technologies and methods in both single camera and multi camera film production. I have also studied a basis in media analysis and film study. I have intermediate knowledge and fluency in Japanese language. I have been studying since the fall of 2021, and recently during the summer of 2024 spent two months studying at Nanzan University in Nagoya Japan.
			 I am currently pursuing a Masters in Library Science. I have a focus on archives and records management. My coursework has dealt with theory behind representation and organization, as well as user services. My interests include motion picture preservation, categorization, and folksonomy. I am still relatively new to the library science field, and am working to expand my knowledge.
			 Outside of academics, I have great interest in tabletop gaming. I regularly not only play tabletop games, but collaborate with others to design my systems for tabletop gaming. I am also interested in birding. I have been an avid birder since the 8th grade, when I began tracking the birds I saw in my backyard. I believe that Indiana has a fascinating array of birds! Though not in Indiana, please take a look at the live cam of a bald eagle nest below! </p>
